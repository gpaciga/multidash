# Multidash

App intended for cycling through multiple dashboards on a single monitor. Prototype project as a little side project, no promises this is either unique or useful.

Very work in progress.

## Usage

Urls to scroll through and the cadence are defined by an array in `src/config.js`.

Type can be either `url` or `img`. Optionally, `seconds` controls how long to stay on the slide.

Images can be hosted in the `public` directory.

Start with `npm run start`.

## Future

- better handling of plain image slides
- interface to click through slides manually
